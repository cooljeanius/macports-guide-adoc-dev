The MacPorts configuration files often do not need to be modified for
the general end user. They contain options that may be of use to
advanced users and port developers. Some automatically configured
options may need to be updated when migrating to a new CPU architecture
or a new OS version.

There are three MacPorts configuration files that define important
variables used by the MacPorts system: `macports.conf`, `sources.conf`,
and `variants.conf`. All MacPorts configurations files are located in
`${prefix}/etc/macports`.

MacPorts configuration file format is a simple key/value pair separated
by either a space or a tab. Lines beginning with '#' are comments, empty
lines are ignored.

[[internals.configuration-files.macports-conf]]
==== macports.conf

macports.conf is the configuration file used to bootstrap the MacPorts
system. This file is read by the port command and determines how it
behaves.

Options locating other .conf files.

sources_conf::
  Where to find the sources list.
  +
  Default: `${prefix}/etc/macports/sources.conf`
variants_conf::
  Where to find global variants definition file (optional).
  +
  Default: `${prefix}/etc/macports/variants.conf`

Options for MacPorts general operating characteristics.

prefix::
  Sets the directory where ports are installed. Any path may be used but
  those with spaces and/or non-ASCII characters should be avoided
  because it can break some ports.
  +
  Default: `/opt/local`
portdbpath::
  Directory where MacPorts keeps working data such as downloaded
  sources, installed port receipts, and the main registry. Same path
  restrictions apply as for '$\{prefix}'.
  +
  Default: $\{prefix}/var/macports
portdbformat::
  Formerly selected the storage type to use for the MacPorts registry:
  flat or sqlite. Currently, only sqlite can be used.
  +
  Default: `sqlite`
build_arch::
  The machine architecture for which to build in normal use. Options
  include: arm64, i386, ppc, ppc64, x86_64
  +
  Default:
  +
  (Snow Leopard and later) `arm64`, `x86_64` or `i386` depending on
  hardware
  +
  (Leopard/Tiger) `i386` or `ppc` depending on hardware
applications_dir::
  Directory in which ports will install native macOS application
  bundles.
  +
  Default: `/Applications/MacPorts`
frameworks_dir::
  Directory in which ports will install native macOS frameworks.
  +
  Default: `${prefix}/Library/Frameworks`
developer_dir::
  Directory where Xcode is installed.
  +
  Default: `/Developer`
buildfromsource::
  Controls whether ports are built from source or downloaded as
  pre-built archives. Setting to 'always' will never use archives,
  'never' will always try to use an archive and fail if one is not
  available. 'ifneeded' will try to fetch an archive and fall back to
  building from source if that isn't possible.
  +
  Default: `ifneeded`
portarchivetype::
  Format of archives in which to store port images. This controls both
  the type of archive created locally after building from source, and
  the type to request from remote servers. Changing this will not affect
  the usability of already installed archives; they can be of any
  supported type. Supported types are: tgz, tar, tbz, tbz2, tlz, txz,
  xar, zip, cpgz, cpio
  +
  Default: `tbz2`
configureccache::
  Use ccache (C/C++ compiler cache) - see https://ccache.samba.org/
  +
  Default: `no`
configuredistcc::
  Use distcc (distributed compiler) - see https://distcc.samba.org/
  +
  Default: `no`
configurepipe::
  Use pipes rather than intermediate files when compiling C/C++/etc
  +
  Default: `yes`
buildnicevalue::
  Lowered scheduling priority (0-20) to use for make when building
  ports.
  +
  Default: 0
buildmakejobs::
  Number of simultaneous make jobs (commands) to use when building
  ports. Using ``0'' will cause a runtime autodetection to use all
  available processor cores.
  +
  Default: 0
portautoclean::
  Set whether to automatically execute ``clean'' after ``install'' of
  ports.
  +
  Default: `yes`
rsync_server::
  Rsync server from which to fetch MacPorts sources.
  +
  Default: rsync.macports.org
rsync_dir::
  Rsync directory from which to pull the base/ component
  (infrastructure) of MacPorts.
  +
  Default: `release/tarballs/base.tar`
rsync_options::
  Rsync options
  +
  Default: -rtzv --delete-after
destroot_umask::
  Umask value to use during the destrooting of a port.
  +
  Default: 022
binpath::
  Sets env(PATH), the directory search path for locating system
  executables (rsync, tar, etc.) during port installation. Only
  applications in these directories are available while ports are being
  installed even if other paths are specified by $PATH in a user's
  environment.
  +
  Default: $\{prefix}/bin:$\{prefix}/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
  +
  [NOTE]
  ====
  The binpath is implicitly defined, but it may be overwritten by
  defining the variable in macports.conf. However, using a non-default
  binpath is discouraged and should only be performed by advanced users.
  ====
host_blacklist::
  Space-separated list of download hosts that should not be used.
  +
  Default: none
  +
  [NOTE]
  ====
  This feature is especially useful if a host turns out to be
  consistently slow and therefore should be excluded for MacPorts'
  actions.
  ====
preferred_hosts::
  Space-separated list of download hosts that should be used
  preferentially.
  +
  Default: none
revupgrade_autorun::
  Controls whether the rev-upgrade action will be run automatically
  after upgrading ports.
  +
  Default: yes
revupgrade_mode::
  Controls the rev-upgrade functionality which checks for broken linking
  and can rebuild ports to fix it. 'rebuild' means ports will
  automatically be rebuilt when broken linking is detected in their
  files, while 'report' means broken files will be scanned for and
  reported but the ports will not be rebuilt.
  +
  Default: rebuild

Options for MacPorts Universal Binaries (+universal variant)

universal_archs::
  The machine architectures to use for +universal variant (multiple
  entries must be space delimited). Options include: arm64, i386, ppc,
  ppc64, x86_64
  +
  Default: `arm64 x86_64` for macOS 11 and later, `x86_64 i386` for 10.6
  through 10.13, `ppc
            i386` for 10.5 and earlier

Options for StartupItems

startupitem_type::
  Options for generated startup items, though this may be overridden by
  the `startupitem.type` Portfile key. Options are ``default'' option,
  ``SystemStarter'', ``launchd'', or ``none''. For an empty or
  ``default'' option, a startupitem type appropriate to the platform is
  used; if ``none'', no port startupitems are installed.
  +
  Default: `default`
startupitem_install::
  Create system-level symlinks to generated StartupItems. If set to
  ``no'', symlinks will not be created; otherwise, symlinks will be
  placed in `/Library/LaunchDaemons` or `/Library/LaunchAgents` as
  appropriate. This setting only applies when building ports from
  source.
  +
  Default: `yes`

Other options

extra_env::
  Extra environment variables to keep. Any variables listed here are
  added to the list of variables that are not removed from the
  environment used while processing ports.
  +
  Default: none

place_worksymlink::
  Set whether to place a symlink named ``work'' from your ports tree to
  the build directory of a port, when the port is being built. This is
  convenient, but may not be ideal if you care about the structure of
  your ports tree. For example, some developers keep their ports tree
  synchronized across multiple computers, and don't want to also synch
  build directories.
  +
  Default: yes

[[internals.configuration-files.sources-conf]]
==== sources.conf

This file enables rsync synchronization of the default ports tree with
the MacPorts rsync server when either of the commands `port
    selfupdate` or `port sync` are run.

Default:
`rsync://rsync.macports.org/macports/release/tarballs/ports.tar [default]`

Optional local repositories are enabled using a file url:
<file:///path/to/localportsrepository>

[[internals.configuration-files.variants-conf]]
==== variants.conf

This optional file specifies any variants you'd like to be invoked
globally. If a variant specified in this file is not supported by a
given Portfile, the variant is simply ignored.

Default: none
