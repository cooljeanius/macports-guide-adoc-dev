The `github` portgroup allows for efficient porting of software hosted
on GitHub.

[[reference.portgroup.github.description]]
==== Description

This portgroup greatly simplifies the porting of software hosted on
GitHub. Provided a GitHub repository author follows common GitHub
practices, a port can be almost fully configured simply by declaring the
repository coordinates. The `github` portgroup is indeed capable of
configuring, amongst other things:

* The port `name`.
* The port `version`.
* The `distfiles` (if the project uses GitHub releases).
* The `livecheck` parameters.

[[reference.portgroup.github.setup]]
==== Setting up the GitHub repository coordinates

The main port configuration is triggered by the usage of the
`github.setup` keyword:

....
PortGroup           github 1.0
github.setup        author project version [tag_prefix]
....

By default, the port `name` will be set to the GitHub project name
(`project`) and `version` will be set to the GitHub project `version`.
The port name can be overridden by using the `name` keyword.

The `tag_prefix` is optional, and it's used to specify a prefix to use
when constructing the tag name. If, for example, the project uses tags
such as `v1.0.0`, then the `tag_prefix` should be set to `v`, as in the
following example:

....
github.setup        author project version v
....

[[reference.portgroup.github.distfilestrategy]]
==== Choosing a distfile strategy

GitHub, and as a consequence the `github` portgroup, offers multiple
mechanisms to get a distfile:

* Distfile from a `git` commit or tag.
* Distfile from a GitHub
https://github.com/blog/1547-release-your-software[release].
* Distfile from a GitHub
https://github.com/blog/1302-goodbye-uploads[download].
* Distfile from Github auto-generated archive downloads

The default behaviour of the portgroup is using GitHub automatically
generated distfile from a `git` commit or tag. However, the best
practice should be using a GitHub release.

[[reference.portgroup.github.distfile]]
==== Distfile from tag or commit

The default behaviour of the `github` portgroup is leveraging GitHub's
ability to create a distfile from a `git` tag or commit. In this case,
the `distname` is irrelevant and should not be set.

If the project's developers do not tag their releases, they should be
encouraged to do so. Until they do, or in the case in which an untagged
development version has to be used, port maintainers have the
possibility of specifying a `git` commit hash and manually set the
`version` field. If the project does not assign version numbers the port
maintainer has to define one. Such versions typically format the date of
the chosen commit using the `YYYYMMDD` pattern. If, for example, the
port maintainer decides to use a changeset with the hash
`0ff25277c3842598d919cd3c73d60768`, committed on April 1, 2014, then the
following would be used:

....
github.setup        someone someproject 0ff25277c3842598d919cd3c73d60768
version             20140401
....

[[reference.portgroup.github.releases]]
==== Distfile from a GitHub release

The `github` portgroup allows maintainers to easily configure the
distfiles when the project uses GitHub releases. A release is the best
distfile candidate, and project maintainers should be encouraged to use
them. To enable this feature, the following keyword must be used:

....
github.tarball_from releases
....

By default, the `github` portgroup sets `distname` to:

....
distname            ${github.project}-${github.version}
....

However, GitHub does not enforce any rule for release distfiles, so port
maintainers may need to override the `distname` as they would do for
other ports.

[[reference.portgroup.github.downloads]]
==== Distfile from a GitHub download

Older projects use the discontinued
https://github.com/blog/1302-goodbye-uploads[downloads] service. New
GitHub downloads can no longer be created, but old ones are still
available.

If the project doesn't have GitHub releases but does have GitHub
downloads, they can be used using the following keyword:

....
github.tarball_from downloads
....

Since GitHub doesn't enforce any naming rules for downloads, the
portgroup can only provide a sensible default value for `distname`,
which can be overridden if necessary.

[[reference.portgroup.github.archive]]
==== Distfile from GitHub archive downloads

Further still, many Github projects have automatically-generated archive
URLs that can be used for downloading distfiles. This can be enabled via
`archive` as follows:

....
github.tarball_from archive
....

[[reference.portgroup.github.submodule]]
==== Using repositories with git submodules

If the project uses `git` submodules, some projects' tag- or
commit-based distfiles will not contain all the necessary files. Once
again, the best distfile candidate (if available) is a distfile from
GitHub releases, as described in the previous sections. However, in the
case a project doesn't provide any other alternative, a project using
submodules can be successfully retrieved by fetching the sources using
`git` and then using a `post-fetch` to initialize the submodules:

....
fetch.type          git

post-fetch {
    system -W ${worksrcpath} "git submodule update --init"
}
....
