The `golang` PortGroup allows for efficient porting of Go-based open
source software.

[[reference.portgroup.golang.description]]
==== Description

This PortGroup greatly simplifies the porting of software written in Go,
especially when the software and its dependencies are hosted on GitHub
or Bitbucket. Provided a project author follows common Go packaging
practices, a port can be almost fully configured simply by declaring the
package identifier.

In particular, Go has strict requirements relating to the arrangement of
code on the filesystem (GOPATH). This PortGroup handles the construction
of the GOPATH for you.

[[reference.portgroup.golang.setup]]
==== Setting up the Go package identifier

The main port configuration is triggered by the usage of the `go.setup`
keyword:

....
PortGroup           golang 1.0
go.setup            domain/author/project version [tag_prefix] [tag_suffix]
....

By default, the port `name` will be set to the package name (`project`)
and `version` will be set to the project `version`. The port name can be
overridden by using the `name` keyword.

The `tag_prefix` and `tag_suffix` are optional, and are used to specify
a prefix/suffix to use when constructing the tag name. If, for example,
the project uses tags such as `v1.0.0`, then the `tag_prefix` should be
set to `v`, as in the following example:

....
go.setup        domain/author/project version v
....

When the `domain` is either `github.com` or `bitbucket.org`, the
appropriate PortGroup will be applied and set up automatically. See
those PortGroups' documentation for details.

Projects hosted elsewhere can be used, but require additional manual
setup.

[[reference.portgroup.golang.dependencies]]
==== Setting up dependencies

The PortGroup provides a keyword to facilitate listing dependencies:
`go.vendors`. Supply a list of vendor package IDs, their versions (git
commit hashes, labeled "lock" as in "lockfile"), and their checksums as
follows. The packages and their versions can usually be found in a
lockfile (e.g. `Gopkg.lock`, `glide.lock`) in the upstream code. All
checksum types supported by the `checksums` keyword are supported here
as well.

....
go.vendors      example.com/dep1/foo \
                    lock    abcdef123456... \
                    rmd160  fedcba654321... \
                    sha256  bdface246135... \
                    size    1234 \
                example.com/dep2/bar \
                    lock    abcdef123456... \
                    rmd160  fedcba654321... \
                    sha256  bdface246135... \
                    size    4321
....

Note that `go.vendors` cannot be used with dependencies hosted outside
of GitHub and Bitbucket. Such dependencies must be handled manually.

After the extraction phase, the vendor packages will be placed alongside
the main port code as appropriate in the GOPATH.

==== Building and destroot

By default this PortGroup runs `go build` from the `${worksrcpath}`.
Assuming this results in a binary with the same name as the project, and
that there are no other files to install, the following is sufficient
for the destroot phase:

....
destroot {
    xinstall -m 755 ${worksrcpath}/${name} ${destroot}${prefix}/bin/
}
....

Please modify as appropriate for each individual port.

[[reference.portgroup.golang.variables]]
==== golang PortGroup Specific Variables

When the golang PortGroup is declared within a Portfile, the following
variables are provided during port install.

go.bin::
  Default: `${prefix}/bin/go`
  +
  The Go binary location.
go.package::
  The package identifier of the port, e.g. `example.com/author/project`.
go.domain, go.author, go.project::
  The individual parts of `${go.package}`.
gopath::
  Default: `${workpath}`/gopath
  +
  The location where source packages will be arranged after the extract
  phase.
goarch::
  Default: 386 or amd64, depending on `${build_arch}`
goos::
  Default: `${os.platform}`

[[reference.portgroup.golang.sugar]]
==== golang PortGroup Sugar

Portfiles using PortGroup golang do not need to define the following
variables:

name, version, homepage, distname, master_sites, livecheck.*::
  Default: see github or bitbucket PortGroups (when project hosted on
  GitHub or Bitbucket)
depends_build::
  Default: port:go
use_configure::
  Default: no
platforms::
  Default: darwin freebsd linux
  +
  Go can target these platforms, but individual ports should override
  this as necessary if only some are actually supported.
build.cmd::
  Default: `${go.bin}` build
build.args::
  Default: ""
build.target::
  Default: ""
build.env::
  Default: GOPATH=`${gopath}` GOARCH=`${goarch}` GOOS=`${goos}`
  CC=`${configure.cc}`
post-extract::
  Default: arranges the project and vendor source files appropriately in
  the GOPATH.
