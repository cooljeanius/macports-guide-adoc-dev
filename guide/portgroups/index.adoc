== PortGroups

[[reference.portgroup.intro]]
=== Introduction

PortGroups are simply include files for portfiles. They can define as
much or as little as a portgroup author feels is necessary to provide a
set of definitions or behaviors common to a group of portfiles, in order
that those portfiles can be expressed as simply as possible with minimum
redundancy.

See the following folder for PortGroup definitions:

`${prefix}/var/macports/sources/rsync.macports.org/macports/release/tarballs/ports/_resources/port1.0/group/`

or if you prefer directly in
https://github.com/macports/macports-ports/tree/master/_resources/port1.0/group[GitHub]

The requirements of a minimum portfile using a portgroup varies by
portgroup. The sections below devoted to each portgroup (or, for
portgroups not documented there yet, the comments in the header of the
portgroup file itself) should provide guidance on how each portgroup is
used. Prospective MacPorts developers are also encouraged to examine
existing portfiles that use these portgroups.
