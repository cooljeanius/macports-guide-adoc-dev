==== java PortGroup Specific Keywords

Portfiles using the java PortGroup allow for port authors to set the
following keywords in addition to the general Portfile keywords.

java.version::
  This keyword indicates that the port requires a Java installation of
  the specified version. If no such installation can be located, and no
  fallback option is specified (see below), the port will fail at the
  pre-fetch phase.
  +
  The version string can indicate a specific version or a range with
  wildcards "+" and "*". Note that Java 8 and earlier are "1.8", etc.,
  while Java 9 and later are "9", etc.
  +
  * Type: optional
  * Example:
  +
....
java.version    1.8+
....
java.fallback::
  This keyword indicates an (optional) port dependency that will be
  added to the ports 'depends-lib' list in the case a prior installation
  of Java satisfying the requested version can not be found. It is
  recommended that only an LTS version of Java be specified as the
  fallback, as non-LTS versions are only supported for 6 months.
  +
  * Type: optional
  * Example:
  +
....
java.fallback   openjdk17
....
