MacPorts keywords are used to specify required or optional items within
a Portfile, or to override default options used by MacPorts base for
individual ports. Keywords are to be used within the ``global'' and
``variant'' sections of Portfiles, and not within optional port phase
declarations.

The global keywords listed below specify information for ports as a
whole, whereas the keywords listed under a port phase specify
information to be used during a particular installation phase.

PortSystem::
  The first non-comment line of every Portfile; it should be followed by
  PortGroup inclusions (if any) and then a blank line. It defines which
  version of the Portfile interpreter will be used. (There is currently
  only one version.)
  +
....
PortSystem          1.0
....
name::
  The name of the port. To avoid special interpretation by shells and
  the like, names should contain only alphanumeric characters,
  underscores, dashes and periods. For projects whose proper names
  contain ``+'' characters, change these to ``x'' (e.g., ``libstdc++''
  becomes ``libstdcxx'').
  +
....
name                foo
....
version::
  The version of the software. Version numbers are often dotted
  decimals, though some projects may use other formats.
  +
  The version keyword should adhere as closely as possible to the format
  used by the upstream project (e.g., as reported by a program's `-v` or
  `--version` flag or on the project's web site), omitting any preceding
  `v` or other extraneous characters that are not part of the version
  number. Especially, the version should not be misformatted merely to
  accommodate an unusual distfile name. For example, if the distfile
  name is `foo-v1_2_3.tar.gz` and the project reports its version as
  `v1.2.3`, the version keyword should be set to `1.2.3` and distname
  should be overridden as needed (ideally by transforming the version
  using a procedure such as `string map`).
  +
  When updating the version of a port that installs a dynamic library,
  check (by examining the second line of output from the `otool -L`
  command run on the library before and after upgrading) whether its
  install name has changed. If it has, increase the revision of every
  port that links with the library to rebuild it with the new library.
  +
....
version             1.23.45
....
revision::
  An optional integer (the default is `0`) that is incremented when a
  port is updated independently of the version of the software. The
  revision line usually follows the version line.
  +
  In Portfiles that have subports, it is often appropriate for each
  subport (including the main port) to have a separate revision line.
  (This does not usually apply to Portfiles for Perl, PHP, Python, or
  Ruby modules which create numerous similar subports for the same
  version of the software.)
  +
  It is recommended to set the revision in all ports, even if the
  revision is 0. This makes it easier for other developers to see where
  to increase the revision in your port, should that need arise. This is
  especially helpful for Portfiles that have subports.
  +
  When increasing the revision in a Portfile with subports, consider
  carefully which of the subports (possibly including the main port)
  need to have their revisions increased.
  +
  When increasing the revision in a Portfile that does not have any
  revision lines yet, take a moment to check if the Portfile has
  subports.
  +
  Just like when a port's version increases, a port is considered
  outdated when its revision increases. To avoid causing users to
  rebuild ports unnecessarily, don't increase the revision unless doing
  so would result in a change for users who already have the ports
  installed.
  +
  Some examples of situations in which a port's revision should usually
  be increased:
  +
  * changing configure arguments or build flags or any other change that
  will cause the installed files to be different
  * installing additional files, such as documentation, or removing any
  files which had previously been installed
  * changing the names or locations of any installed files
  * adding a dependency that causes the installed files to be different
  * a library dependency's install_name has changed
  * removing a variant that a user might have installed
  * adding a variant name to default_variants
  +
  Some examples of situations in which a port's revision should not
  usually be increased:
  +
  * fixing a build failure
  * adding a dependency to depends_fetch, depends_extract,
  depends_patch, depends_build, or depends_test
  * adding a direct dependency on a port that was already an indirect
  dependency
  * changing a dependency's type, e.g. from depends_lib to depends_build
  * removing a dependency that is not used
  * setting or changing the port's license
  * adding a new non-default variant
  * removing a variant name from default_variants
  * changing comments or whitespace in the Portfile
  * any other change to the Portfile that does not change the files it
  installs
  +

revision            1
....
epoch::
  An optional integer (the default is `0`) that must be increased when a
  port is updated to a version that appears (according to the `vercmp`
  procedure's version number comparison algorithm) to be less than the
  previous version. For example, updating from `2.0-rc1` to `2.0`, or
  from `1.10` to `1.2`, or from `20070928` to `1.0`.
  +
  The purpose of increasing the epoch is to cause MacPorts to consider a
  port to be outdated, even if that wouldn't otherwise be the case due
  to the specific version numbers. Don't set the epoch unless it's
  required. In most ports, the version number advances according to the
  normal dotted-decimal sequence, so most ports will never have a need
  to set the epoch.
  +
  Some Portfile authors have used large epoch values that look like
  dates in YYYYMMDD format (e.g., `20091231`). When it is necessary to
  increase the epoch in such ports, the new epoch can be set to the
  current date. It is not recommended to use this format when adding an
  epoch to a port that does not already have one; instead, just set the
  epoch to `1`, and when needing to increase an existing small epoch,
  increase it by 1.
  +
....
epoch               1
....
  +
  [NOTE]
  ====
  A port's epoch can never be decreased. Removing the epoch from the
  port would decrease it to its default value of `0`, so once added to a
  port the epoch can also never be removed. When adding an epoch, take
  extra care to ensure that it is necessary, since a mistakenly added
  epoch cannot be undone. In Portfiles that have subports with different
  software versions, consider whether the epoch needs to be increased in
  all subports or only in some of them.
  ====
categories::
  The category under which the ported software falls. The first category
  should be the same as the directory within which the Portfile is
  stored; secondary and tertiary categories may be selected.
  +
....
categories          net security
....
maintainers::
  A port's maintainers are the people who have agreed to take
  responsibility for keeping the port up-to-date. Most ports have only a
  single maintainer, but some ports have two or more co-maintainers. The
  `maintainers` keyword lists the maintainers' GitHub usernames or email
  addresses. GitHub usernames start with an `@` symbol. Email addresses
  are preferably listed in the obfuscated form below to hide them from
  spambots:
  +
  * For addresses in domain @macports.org, simply omit the domain name.
  * For addresses in other domains, e.g., account@example.org, use the
  convention `example.org:account` to specify the address.
  +
  In the example below, the port is maintained by a GitHub user named
  neverpanic, and the owners of the two email addresses
  jdoe@macports.org and julesverne@example.org
  +
....
maintainers         @neverpanic \
                    jdoe \
                    example.org:julesverne
....
  +
  Braces can be used to express that these refer to the same person, for
  example the GitHub username and an email. In the following example,
  the port is maintained by a GitHub user named jverne, that can also be
  contacted directly at julesverne@example.org.
  +
....
maintainers         {@jverne example.org:julesverne}
....
  +
  [NOTE]
  ====
  The address `nomaintainer` designates a port that is not maintained by
  anybody and may be modified by any committer. Feel free to claim
  maintainership of a nomaintainer port if desired. The address
  `openmaintainer` designates a port that has a maintainer who allows
  minor changes to be committed without his or her prior approval. Port
  maintainers who are not committers are encouraged to add
  `openmaintainer` to their ports.
  ====
description::
  A short sentence fragment describing the software.
  +
....
description         a classic shooter arcade game
....
long_description::
  One or more sentences describing the software.
  +
  The long description can be based on a description provided by the
  upstream project (e.g., in its readme or on its web site) but avoid
  repeating information already present elsewhere in the Portfile, such
  as the software's license (see the `license` keyword) or the platforms
  on which it runs (see the `platforms` keyword), and avoid including
  information irrelevant to a MacPorts user, such as compilation
  instructions or other steps the Portfile has already performed for the
  user. More specific usage instructions are best left to the `notes`
  keyword.
  +
  If a port provides a program that is different from the port name, it
  can be a good idea to include the program name in the long description
  so that a user could find it by searching.
  +
  Long descriptions are usually a single paragraph. MacPorts will
  word-wrap long lines to the terminal width as needed. Break long lines
  with escaped newlines for better legibility within the Portfile. If
  literal newlines need to be displayed to the user, they can be
  inserted using `\n`. Place the `\n` at the beginning of the next line,
  not at the end of the previous line. To create a new paragraph, insert
  two newlines.
  +
  Sometimes the port's name and short description are reused as part of
  the long description. When referencing the `description` keyword (or
  any other list keyword with more than one item), it should be preceded
  with the expand operator.
  +
....
long_description    ${name} is {*}${description} derived from \
                    the game alien-munchers.  Not suitable for \
                    children under two years old.

                    \n* bar, a high-performance amet consectetur \
                    \n* baz, an eiusmod tempor converter
....
homepage::
  The software's primary web site.
  +
  Usually the homepage should be a URL that does not redirect to another
  URL. For example, if an http URL redirects to an https URL, list the
  https URL. Or if a URL without a trailing slash redirects to the URL
  with the trailing slash, list the URL with the trailing slash. If the
  project advertises a short URL that redirects to a longer URL, it is
  acceptable to list the short URL despite the redirect.
  +
  When the homepage is just a hostname with no path component, don't
  include a trailing slash.
  +
....

....

....
platforms::
  A list of the platforms on which the port is expected to work.
  Defaults to `darwin` if not set. Consists of a list of platform
  specifiers, each of which is at minimum a platform name and may also
  include version information. Possible platform names are:
  +
  * `darwin` (equivalent to specifying both `macosx` and `puredarwin`)
  * `macosx` (macOS as distributed by Apple)
  * `puredarwin` (the open-source Darwin OS without Apple's proprietary
  components)
  * `freebsd`
  * `linux`
  * `netbsd`
  * `openbsd`
  * `solaris`
  * `sunos`
  +
  A platform specifier that is just a platform name is purely
  informational for users; it is displayed in the output of `port info`
  but has no other effect. Ports for software that does not require
  macOS-specific features can generally use the default value of
  `darwin`. Most ports use this value on the presumption that they would
  work on Pure Darwin, even if that has not been attempted. Ports for
  software that is known to require macOS-specific features should use
  `macosx`. Including the xcode portgroup will change the default to
  `macosx` automatically.
  +
  See also `os.platform`.
  +
....
platforms           macosx freebsd
....
  +
  (Added: MacPorts 2.8.0) A platform specifier can also be a list, where
  the first element is a platform name and subsequent elements are pairs
  of comparison operators and versions. This indicates the version
  ranges of each platform that the port works on.
  +
  If a platform specifier's name matches `${os.platform}`, then each
  comparison operator in the specifier is applied to `${os.version}` as
  the left operand and the listed version as the right operand. If any
  of the comparisons evaluate to false, then the default value of
  `known_fail` is changed to `yes`.
  +
  Possible operators are: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`. The `==` and
  `!=` operators support globbing. The rest of the operators compare as
  per the `vercmp` command.
  +
  Examples:
  +
  A port that works on Darwin 12 and later:
  +
....
platforms           {darwin >= 12}
....
  +
  A port that works on Darwin versions between 10 and 19 inclusive:
  +
....
platforms           {darwin >= 10 < 20}
....
  +
  A port that works on Darwin versions between 10 and 19 but not version
  12.x:
  +
....
platforms           {darwin >= 10 != 12.* < 20}
....
  +
  The special value `any` can also be used to indicate that a port will
  install identical files across platforms or platform versions. This
  can help to reduce the number of binary archives that have to be
  built. In most cases, this is only applicable to ports that don't
  install any architecture-specific files.
  +
  Ports that install identical files on any platform should use:
  +
....
platforms           any
....
  +
  Ports that install identical files on any Darwin version, but may
  install different files on other platforms (or don't work on other
  platforms), should use:
  +
....
platforms           {darwin any}
....
  +
  It is possible to combine `any` with version ranges. A port that only
  works on Darwin 17 or later and installs identical files regardless of
  the Darwin version would do this:
  +
....
platforms           {darwin any >= 17}
....
supported_archs::
  The CPU architectures for which this port can be built. Archs
  currently supported by macOS are: arm64, i386, ppc, ppc64, x86_64. If
  this option is not set, it is assumed that the port can build for all
  archs. If a port does not install any architecture-specific files, use
  the special value `noarch`.
  +
  If the building architecture isn't among supported_archs, port fails
  with an error message, except when building on x86_64 and
  supported_archs contains i386 or when building on ppc64 and
  supported_archs contains ppc, in which case the port will be built in
  32-bit mode.
  +
....
supported_archs     i386 ppc
....
  +
....
supported_archs     noarch
....
license::
  The proper format for license consists of the license name, followed
  by a hyphen and number if indicating a specific version. A space
  should be placed between licenses if there is more than one that
  applies. If an element in the license list is itself a list, it is
  interpreted as offering a choice of any one of the licenses in the
  sub-list.
  +
  If the version number is a ``.0'' version, the ``.0'' should be
  omitted to make the version an integer. If the author gives the choice
  of using a given license or ``any later version'' of it, append a plus
  sign (+) to the version number. If the version specified in this case
  is also the earliest version, just leave out the version number
  entirely since it implies all versions.
  +
....
license             GPL-3
....
  +
....
license             {freetype GPL}
....
license_noconflict::
  By default, it is assumed that ports may use libraries or headers from
  their dependencies and thus form a derivative work. A dependency with
  an incompatible license thus prevents the port from being distributed
  in binary form. If a dependency with an incompatible license is not
  used in such a way that a derivative work is formed, or should not
  prevent binary distribution for any other reason, add its name to this
  list.
  +
....
license_noconflict  openssl
....
  +
....
license_noconflict  readline gdbm
....
use_xcode::
  (Added: MacPorts 2.6.0) By default, it is assumed on macOS that ports
  will not need tools from Xcode.app unless (1) Command Line Tools
  aren't installed, (2) you are on an old version of Mac OS X that does
  not support the xcode-select mechanism, or (3) the port uses
  `build.type xcode` or includes the `xcode` PortGroup. If a port needs
  to use Xcode (i.e., xcodebuild) in any way, `use_xcode yes` should be
  set or the port should include the xcode PortGroup. The environment
  variable DEVELOPER_DIR is now exported during all build phases, set to
  the value of `${configure.developer_dir}` which may be the directory
  of Xcode or CLT depending on use_xcode. This means that libxcselect
  shims (i.e., /usr/bin/clang) will resolve to Xcode/CLT. Build systems
  that ignore the environment may accidentally use Xcode which will
  cause a failure in trace mode.
  +
....
use_xcode           no
....
  +
....
use_xcode           yes
....
known_fail::
  Setting this option to `yes` indicates that the port is known not to
  work. Users will be told this and asked for confirmation if they
  attempt to install it, and the Buildbot and GitHub Actions will not
  attempt to build it.
  +
  Don't set this option conditionally on the basis of anything that can
  change dynamically, such as `$build_arch` or `$xcodeversion`, since it
  will be recorded in the static PortIndex. If a port works only on
  certain OS versions, use the `platforms` option to indicate this
  rather than setting `known_fail` directly.
  +
....
known_fail           yes
....
macosx_deployment_target::
  The macOS release to target.
  +
  During the configure phase, environment variable
  `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` is set to the specified value.
  +
  This option is also used when building binary packages, via
  `port pkg`, `port mpkg`, `port dmg`, and `port mdmg`. Specifically,
  MacPorts will create a package/DMG that is compatible with the desired
  macOS release. In addition, it is used to set version-related metadata
  for the Apple installer package, including `allowed-os-versions`.
  +
....
macosx_deployment_target 10.8
....
installs_libs::
  By default, it is assumed that ports may install libraries or headers
  that can be incorporated into their dependents. If this is not the
  case, set `installs_libs` to `no`. This means that this port's
  dependents need not check that it is installed for the same
  architectures as them; that it is permissible to distribute binaries
  of the dependents even if their licenses conflict with the license of
  this port; and that updates to this port can never result in broken
  dynamic linking in its dependents.
  +
....
installs_libs        no
....
add_users::
  Consists of a list of usernames and settings. At appropriate times
  during the port installation process, a user will be created for each
  username with the corresponding settings.
  +
  Settings are of the form `name=value`. A setting applies to the
  username that appeared most recently before it in the list.
  +
  Applicable options are: `group`, `gid` (may be used instead of
  `group`), `passwd`, `realname`, `home`, and `shell`.
  +
....
add_users           squid \
                    group=squid \
                    realname=Squid\ Proxy \
                    home=${prefix}/var/squid
....
  +
....
add_users           user1 group=mygroup \
                    user2 group=mygroup
....
