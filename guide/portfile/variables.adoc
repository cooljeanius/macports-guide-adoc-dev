additional variables available to ports that are assigned to a MacPorts
Portgroup, see portgroup(7).

All of these variables except `prefix` are read-only!

prefix::
  Installation prefix, set at compile time and displayed in
  `${prefix}/etc/macports/macports.conf` â€”- may be overridden on a
  per-port basis, for example to install into a wholly-contained
  subdirectory of $\{prefix}, but most ports should have no reason to do
  so.
  +
  Default: `/opt/local`
libpath::
  Path to the MacPorts Tcl libraries.
portpath::
  Full path to the Portfile of the port being executed. Portfile
  repositories are defined in the file
  link:#internals.configuration-files.sources-conf[sources.conf].
  +
  Default:
  `${prefix}/var/macports/sources/rsync.macports.org/macports/release/tarballs/ports/<category>/<portname>/`
filesdir::
  Path to files directory relative to `${portpath}`.
  +
  Value: `files`
filespath::
  Full path to files directory.
  +
  Value: `${portpath}/${filesdir}`
workpath::
  Full path to work directory.
  +
  Value: `${portbuildpath}/work`
worksrcpath::
  Full path to extracted source code.
  +
  Value: `${workpath}/${worksrcdir}`
destroot::
  Full path into which software will be destrooted.
  +
  Value: `${workpath}/destroot`
distpath::
  Location to store downloaded distfiles.
  +
  Value: `${portdbpath}/distfiles/${dist_subdir}`
