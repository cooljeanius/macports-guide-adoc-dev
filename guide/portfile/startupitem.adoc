A StartupItem is a MacPorts facility to run ``daemons,'' a Unix term for
programs that run continuously in the background, rather than under the
direct control of a user; for example, mail servers, network listeners,
etc. Ports that use StartupItem keywords create scripts for
https://developer.apple.com/macosx/launchd.html[launchd], which is the
Apple facility introduced with Mac OS X 10.4 to replace xinetd for
starting and managing daemons. To support `launchd`, a program named
`daemondo` is provided by MacPorts base that serves as an adapter
between `launchd` and daemons (``executable'' StartupItems) or
traditional Unix startup scripts that start daemons (``script''
StartupItems).

There are three categories of StartupItem keywords. Those that trigger
StartupItem creation and logging, those that specify attributes of
``executable'' StartupItems, and those that specify attributes of
``script'' StartupItems.

[NOTE]
====
The variable `startupitem_type` in
`${prefix}/etc/macports/macports.conf` may be set to `none` to override
the default value of the `startupitem.type` option in Portfiles; this
prevents StartupItems from being created.

Additionally, the `startupitem_install` variable can be set to `no` in
`macports.conf` to override the default value of the
`startupitem.install` option, which will prevent links from being
created under `/Library`. This is useful for MacPorts installations that
are not used with root privileges.

=== StartupItem Attributes

The keywords in this section may be used with either ``executable'' or
``script'' StartupItems (see below).

startupitem.autostart::
  Whether to automatically load the StartupItem after activating the
  port.
  +
  * Default: `no`
  * Example:
  +
....
startupitem.autostart      yes
....
startupitem.create::
  Trigger the creation of a StartupItem.
  +
  * Default: `no`
  * Example:
  +
....
startupitem.create      yes
....
startupitem.custom_file::
  (Added: MacPorts 2.8) Path to a file to use as a StartupItem, instead
  of creating one.
  +
  * Default: `(empty)`
  * Example:
  +
....
startupitem.custom_file      ${worksrcpath}/mydaemon.plist
....
startupitem.debug::
  Enable additional debug logging.
  +
  * Default: `no`
  * Example:
  +
....
startupitem.debug      yes
....
startupitem.install::
  Whether to install a link to the StartupItem in the appropriate
  subdirectory of `/Library` (see `startupitem.location`) so that it can
  be launched automatically after rebooting.
  +
  * Default: `yes`
  * Example:
  +
....
startupitem.install        no
....
startupitem.location::
  Chooses the subdirectory in which to install the StartupItem. Also
  affects how it will be loaded: LaunchDaemons must be loaded as root,
  and only one instance will run for the whole system. LaunchAgents are
  loaded as a normal user, and one instance per user can run.
  +
  * Default: `LaunchDaemons`
  * Example:
  +
....
startupitem.location        LaunchAgents
....
startupitem.logfile::
  Path to a logfile for logging events about the lifetime of the
  StartupItem. Depending on the type of StartupItem, and the manner in
  which it is started, standard output from the daemon may also be
  directed to the logfile.
  +
  * Default: `/dev/null`
  * Example:
  +
....
startupitem.logfile     ${prefix}/var/log/mydaemon.log
....
startupitem.logevents::
  Control whether or not to log events to the log file. If logevents is
  set, events with timestamps are logged to the logfile.
  +
  * Default: `no`
  * Example:
  +
....
startupitem.logevents   yes
....
startupitem.name::
  Sets the name for the StartupItem. Defaults to the name of the port,
  so this keyword is usually unnecessary.
  +
  * Default: `${name}`
  * Example:
  +
....
startupitem.name        dhcpd
....
startupitem.netchange::
  Cause the daemon to be restarted when a change in network state is
  detected.
  +
  * Default: `no`
  * Example:
  +
....
startupitem.netchange   yes
....
startupitem.type::
  The type of the StartupItem. Supported values are `launchd` for a
  macOS `launchd` .plist, or `none` for no StartupItem.
  +
  * Default: `launchd` if on macOS and `${startupitem.create}` is true,
  `none` otherwise
  * Example:
  +
....
startupitem.type   launchd
....
startupitem.user::
  (Added: MacPorts 2.7) Run the daemon via the specified user.
  +
  * Default: `none`
  * Example:
  +
....
startupitem.user   my_daemon_user
....
startupitem.group::
  (Added: MacPorts 2.7) Run the daemon via the specified group.
  +
  * Default: `none`
  * Example:
  +
....
startupitem.group   my_daemon_group
....
startupitems::
  Used when a port needs to install more than one StartupItem, this
  option consists of a list where alternating elements represent keys
  and values. Each key corresponds to one of the `startupitem.*`
  options, and the following value is associated with it. Each
  StartupItem defined in the list must specify at least a name. Each
  other key/value pair is associated with the StartupItem named most
  recently in the list. Any keys that are not defined for a given
  StartupItem will use the value of the corresponding `startupitem.*`
  option.
  +
  * Default: none
  * Example:
  +
....
startupitems        name        myport-system \
                    location    LaunchDaemons \
                    executable  ${prefix}/sbin/myportd \
                    name        myport-session \
                    location    LaunchAgents \
                    executable  ${prefix}/bin/myport-agent
....

[[reference.startupitems.executable]]
=== Executable StartupItems

Daemons run continuously, so monitoring the health of daemon processes
and restarting them if they die is an important StartupItems' feature.
``Executable'' StartupItems are preferred over ``script'' StartupItems
because `daemondo` launches the daemon _directly_, rather than
_indirectly_ via a script, and therefore it automatically knows how to
monitor a daemon process and restart it if it dies. Daemons used with
``executable'' StartupItems may be programs or scripts (shell, perl,
python, etc.) as long as the script _itself_ is the daemon, rather than
merely what launches the daemon. In the latter case ``script''
StartupItems are to be used.

[NOTE]
====
Since ``script'' and ``executable'' are mutually exclusive StartupItem
types, the `startupitem.executable` keyword may not be used in a
Portfile that uses any keywords listed in the
link:#reference.startupitems.script[Script StartupItems section].
====

startupitem.executable::
  Specifies the name of the daemon to be run. It may have multiple
  arguments, but they must be appropriate for a call to exec; arbitrary
  shell code may not be used.
  +
  [NOTE]
  ====
  Some daemons ``daemonize'' by detaching themselves from the
  controlling tty before sending themselves to the background, thus
  making themselves a child of the original process. A daemon to be
  started with `startupitem.executable` must not be allowed to do this
  or daemondo will think the process has died and start multiple
  instances. Often daemons have a command switch to run in the
  foreground, and this method should be used for daemons that detach.
  ====
  +
  * Default: none
  * Example:
  +
....
startupitem.executable  ${prefix}/sbin/vm-pop3d -d 10 -t 600
....
  +
  [NOTE]
  ====
  Do not wrap values in quotes if passing arguments to the daemon;
  ``executable'' StartupItem elements must be tagged individually so the
  spaces between arguments serve as delimiters for ``string'' tags. For
  example, this startupitem key/value pair:

....
startupitem.executable    ${prefix}/sbin/vm-pop3d -d 10 -t 600
....

  generates a .plist file with these tags:

....
<key>ProgramArguments</key>
<array>
    <string>/opt/local/bin/daemondo</string>
    <string>--label=vm-pop3d</string>
    <string>--start-cmd</string>
    <string>/opt/local/sbin/vm-pop3d</string>
    <string>-d</string>
    <string>10</string>
    <string>-t</string>
    <string>600</string>
    <string>;</string>
</array>
....
  ====

[[reference.startupitems.script]]
=== Script StartupItems

StartupItems of type ``script'' create a wrapper during port
installation for `daemondo` that will be used to launch a daemon startup
script present in an application's source distribution (MacPorts does
not create daemon startup scripts) for daemons that require a script.

[NOTE]
====
``Executable'' StartupItems are the preferred type since ``script''
StartupItems launch daemons _indirectly_, and this requires that port
authors use the `startupitem.pidfile` keyword so that `daemondo` can
check this pid file to see is a daemon process has died and restart it.
Any time a script (or an executable) itself serves as a daemon, use the
``executable'' StartupItem type so daemondo will launch it directly and
track its health automatically. Additionally, since ``script'' and
``executable'' are mutually exclusive StartupItem types, the
`startupitem.executable` keyword may not be used in a Portfile that uses
``script'' StartupItem keywords.
====

A typical snippet of a startup script that may be used with a ``script''
StartupItem is shown below. Notice that the script is not a daemon;
rather the script indirectly launches the vm-pop3d daemon.

....
#!/bin/sh

case "$1" in
    start)
        echo -n "Starting vm-pop3d: "
        /opt/local/sbin/vm-pop3d -d 10 -t 600

[... trimmed ...]
....

startupitem.start; startupitem.stop; startupitem.restart::
  Specify a shell script to start, stop, and restart the daemon. In the
  absence of `startupitem.restart`, the daemon will be restarted by
  taking the stop action, followed by the start action.
  +
  * Default: none
  * Examples:
  +
....
startupitem.start       "${prefix}/share/mysql/mysql.server start"
startupitem.stop        "${prefix}/share/mysql/mysql.server stop"
startupitem.restart     "${prefix}/share/mysql/mysql.server restart"
....
  +
  [NOTE]
  ====
  Wrap the stop, start, and restart values in quotes so they will be
  placed in the wrapper tagged as a single element.
  ====
startupitem.init::
  Shell code that will be executed prior to any of the options
  `startupitem.start`, `startupitem.stop` and `startupitem.restart`.
  +
  * Default: none
  * Example:
  +
....
startupitem.init        BIN=${prefix}/sbin/bacula-fd
....
startupitem.pidfile::
  This keyword must be defined properly for `daemondo` to be able to
  monitor daemons launched via ``script'' StartupItems and restart them
  if they die. It specifies two things: a process id (PID) file handling
  method, and a pidfile name and path.
  +
  * Default: `none
                ${prefix}/var/run/${name}.pid`
  +
  Default: [none] | [`${prefix}/var/run/${name}.pid`]
  * Values [none auto manual clean] [</path/to/pidfile>]
  * Example:
  +
....
startupitem.pidfile     auto ${prefix}/var/run/${name}.pidfile
....
  +
  PID file handling options:
  +
  * `none` - daemondo will not create or track a PID file, so it won't
  know when a daemon dies.
  * `auto` - The started process is expected to create a PID file that
  contains the PID of the running daemon; daemondo then reads the PID
  from the file and tracks the process. The started process must delete
  the PID file if this is necessary.
  * `clean` - The started process is expected to create a PID file that
  contains the PID of the running daemon; daemondo then reads the PID
  from the file and tracks the process, and deletes the PID file if it
  detects the daemon has died.
  * `manual` - This option should only be used if an ``executable''
  StartupItem could be used (daemondo launches a daemon directly) _and_
  a port author wants a PID file written for some special use. A PID
  file is not needed to detect process death for daemons launched
  directly by daemondo. As with executable StartupItems, daemondo
  remembers the PID of the launched process and tracks it automatically.

[[reference.startupitems.launchd]]
=== Loading / Unloading StartupItems into launchd

A port with a StartupItem places a link to a .plist file for the port's
daemon within `/Library/LaunchDaemons/`. A .plist file is an XML file;
MacPorts installs .plist files tagged as ``disabled'' for the sake of
security. You may enable a startup script (tag the.plist file as
``enabled'') and load it into `launchd` with a single command as shown.

....
%% sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.mysql5.plist
....

You may stop a running startup script, disable it (tag the.plist file as
``disabled''), and unload it from `launchd` with a single command as
shown.

....
%% sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.mysql5.plist
....

[[reference.startupitems.internals]]
=== StartupItem Internals

During port installation a MacPorts StartupItem creates a .plist file in
`${prefix}/etc/LaunchDaemons/`, and places a symbolic link to the .plist
file within `/Library/LaunchDaemons/` if `${startupitem.install}` is
true.

For example, the StartupItem for the mysql5 port is
`org.macports.mysql5.plist`, and it is linked as shown.

....
%% ls -l /Library/LaunchDaemons
....

....
org.macports.mysql5.plist ->
/opt/local/etc/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.mysql5/org.macports.mysql5.plist
....

For ``script'' StartupItems, in addition to a .plist file, a wrapper is
also created.

....
%% ls -l /opt/local/etc/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.mysql5/
....

....
-rwxr-xr-x   2 root  wheel  475 Aug  2 14:16 mysql5.wrapper
-rw-r--r--   2 root  wheel  975 Aug  2 14:16 org.macports.mysql5.plist
....

The wrapper manipulates the script as specified in the startupitem.start
and startupitem.stop keywords. An example wrapper script snippet is
shown below.

....
#!/bin/sh

# MacPorts generated daemondo support script

# Start
Start()
{
    /opt/local/share/mysql5/mysql/mysql.server start
}

# Stop
Stop()
{
    /opt/local/share/mysql5/mysql/mysql.server stop
}
