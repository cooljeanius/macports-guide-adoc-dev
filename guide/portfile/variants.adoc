MacPorts variants are conditional modifications of port installation
behavior during port installation. There are two types of variants:
user-selected variants and platform variants. User-selected variants are
options selected by a user when a port is installed; platform variants
are selected automatically by MacPorts base according to the OS or
hardware platform (darwin, freebsd, linux, i386, powerpc, etc.).

[[reference.variants.user-selected]]
==== User-Selected Variants

User-selected variants are those that are defined so a user can invoke
them to enable port options at install time. They also allow a port
author a level of modularity and control using the keyword
`default_variants` (see below).

[NOTE]
====
Variant names may contain only letters, numbers and underscore
characters. In particular, the hyphen is not a valid character in
variant names because it would conflict with the notation for
deselecting a variant.
====

variant <name> [requires <variant1 variant2 ...>] [conflicts <variant1
variant2 ...>] [description <description>]::
  The variant declaration may contain any keywords that can be placed in
  a Portfile's global section. If you wish to execute system (shell)
  calls or Tcl extensions during the execution of a port phase, you
  should place those statements within a `variant_isset` conditional
  within a phase declaration and not within the variant declaration
  itself. Dependencies and conflicts with other variants in the same
  port can be expressed with `requires` and `conflicts` options as shown
  below.
  +
  * Default: none
  * Examples:
  +
....
variant gnome requires glib {
    configure.args-append   --with-gnome
    depends_lib-append      port:gnome-session
}
....
  +
....
variant apache2 conflicts apache {
    configure.args-append \
        --with-apxs2=${prefix}/apache2/bin/apxs
}
....
default_variants::
  The optional `default_variants` keyword is used to specify variants
  that a port author wishes to have enabled by default. This allows for
  Portfile modularity and also allows users to suppress default variants
  if they wish.
  +
  * Default: none
  * Example:
  +
....
default_variants    +ssl +tcpd
....
  +
  Default variants may be suppressed by preceding a variant name with a
  ``-'' as shown in this example.
  +
....
%% port install foo -ssl
....
universal_variant::
  When using MacPorts on macOS, a universal variant is defined by
  default to configure ports with universal flags. The variant can be
  overridden if the default code does not work (see the
  link:#reference.phases.configure.universal[Configure Universal]
  section above), or suppressed if a universal variant does not function
  properly for a given port.
  +
  * Default: `yes`
  * Example:
  +
....
universal_variant   no
....

[[reference.variants.descriptions]]
==== User-Selected Variant Descriptions

User-selected variants ought to provide a description, which will be
displayed when using command `port variants foo`. The syntax used for
the description keyword is shown below.

....
variant bar description {Add IMAP support} {}
....

Descriptions should be short but clear, and not merely repeat the name
of the variant. To allow for compatibility for possible MacPorts GUI
support, a good rule of thumb is to use sentence fragments for brevity,
with a capitalized first letter and no trailing punctuation. Think of
them as short labels such as ones you'd find next to a GUI checkbox or
radio button. Thus, it would be better to write ``Build with support for
foo'' instead of ``Builds with support for foo''; ``Add support for
foo'' would be better than ``Adds support for foo''.

Variant descriptions are strings, so one should take care not to put
whitespace between the brackets and the beginning and end of the variant
description, and also not to use unnecessary whitespace, unlike with
port descriptions and long_descriptions.

[[reference.variants.platform]]
==== Platform Variants

Platform variants are either defined by default in MacPorts base, or
defined by a port author to customize a port's installation according to
OS (operating system) or hardware platform.

platform <os> [<version>] [<arch>]::
  MacPorts allows platform-specific port options to be specified in a
  Portfile for handling differences between platforms and versions of
  the same platform.
  +
  `platform darwin
            version` can be used to handle different tasks depending on
  the version of Darwin, the core operating system underlying macOS.
  <version> is the major version of Darwin, and can be `18` for macOS
  Mojave 10.14, `17` for macOS High Sierra 10.13, `16` for macOS Sierra
  10.12, and so on.
  +
  * Examples:
  +
....
platform darwin 10 {
    configure.env-append LIBS=-lresolv
}
....
  +
....
platform darwin i386 {
    configure.args-append --disable-mmx
}
....
  +
....
platform darwin 8 powerpc {
    configure.compiler gcc-3.3
}
....

[NOTE]
====
Though a combination of OS version and hardware platform may be
specified in a single platform statement (e.g., darwin 8 i386), it is
not possible to specify a range of platforms with a single statement.
For example, to select Darwin versions 9 and 10 while excluding all
others, you would need two statements: `platform darwin 9` and
`platform darwin 10`. Alternately, you could make that behavior the
port's default, and add a `platform darwin 8` block to remove it again.
