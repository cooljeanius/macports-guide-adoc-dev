== Installing MacPorts

This chapter shows you how to install MacPorts and its prerequisites
step-by-step. Note that the section about
link:#installing.xcode[installing Xcode] is macOS-specific. If you wish
to install MacPorts on another platform, first make sure you have a
working C compiler installed, skip ahead to
link:#installing.macports.source[installing MacPorts from source], and
continue to the end of the chapter.

[[installing.xcode]]
=== Install Xcode

https://developer.apple.com/xcode/[Xcode] is a package provided by Apple
containing compilers, libraries and additional tools required to develop
applications for macOS.

[NOTE]
====
Always make sure to install the latest available version of Xcode for
your macOS release; using outdated versions of Xcode may cause port
install failures. Also note that Xcode is not updated via OS X's
Software Update utility on OS versions prior to 10.6, and is updated via
the Mac App Store starting with 10.7.
====

Follow the instructions for your version of macOS:

[[installing.xcode.mavericks]]
==== Install Xcode on OS X 10.9 or Later

(Optional) Download the latest version of Xcode
https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action[from the Apple
developer website] or get it
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835[using the Mac App
Store].

A few ports require a full Xcode installation to use, but most donâ€™t
(read the description of the
link:#reference.keywords.use_xcode[use_xcode keyword] for specifics). If
you are OK with being unable to use these ports, you do not need to
install Xcode.

Next, open a terminal, run `xcode-select --install`, and click the
Install button to install the required command line developer tools.
Don't worry if you see a message telling you the software cannot be
installed because it is not currently available from the Software Update
Server. This usually means you already have the latest version
installed. You can also get the command line tools from
https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action[the Apple developer
website].

[[installing.xcode.lion]]
==== Install Xcode on OS X 10.7 Lion or OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion

Download the latest version of Xcode
https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action[from the Apple
developer website] or get it
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835[using the Mac App
Store].

[[installing.xcode.lion.43]]
===== Xcode 4.3 and Later

Xcode 4.3 and later do not automatically install the command line tools,
but MacPorts requires them. To install them, open the Xcode application,
go to the Preferences window, to the Downloads section, and click the
Install button next to Command Line Tools. Be sure to return to this
window after every Xcode upgrade to ensure that the command line tools
are also upgraded.

If you wish to create Installer packages with `port pkg`, you will also
need to install PackageMaker, which is in the ``Auxiliary Tools for
Xcode'' package as of Xcode 4.3. The download page for this package can
be opened via the Xcode -> Open Developer Tool -> More Developer
Tools... menu item. After downloading and mounting the disk image, drag
the PackageMaker application to your /Applications directory.

[[installing.xcode.snowleopard]]
==== Install Xcode on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard

If you are using Mac OS X 10.6, there are two branches of Xcode which
could be considered to be the latest, 3.2.x and 4.x. Xcode 4 costs
money, but Xcode 3 is still available free of charge. There are two
options for downloading it:

[arabic]
. Xcode 3.2 - smaller download, but you will need to run Software Update
after installing to get the latest version. Note that Apple might at
some point discontinue providing these updates via their update servers.
. Xcode 3.2.6 and iOS SDK 4.3 - includes the iOS SDK which is not needed
for MacPorts.

Both are available from the
https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action[Apple developer
website]. You may also be able to install Xcode 3.2 from your Mac OS X
10.6 DVD and then run Software Update to get the latest version.

Ensure that those of the following options that are available in the
installer for your version of Xcode are selected:

* UNIX Development
* System Tools
* X11 SDK
* Command Line Support

[[installing.xcode.other]]
==== Install Xcode on Older Releases of Mac OS X

If you have an earlier release of Mac OS X, you may download the latest
version of Xcode for Mac OS X 10.5 (Xcode 3.0 and Xcode 3.1 Developer
Tools) or 10.4 (Xcode 2.4.1 and Xcode 2.5 Developer Tools) from the
https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action[Apple developer
website].

Ensure that those of the following options that are available in the
installer for your version of Xcode are selected:

* UNIX Development
* System Tools
* X11 SDK
* Command Line Support

[[installing.macports]]
=== Install MacPorts

If you are using macOS, you should install MacPorts using the macOS
package installer unless you do not wish to install it to `/opt/local/`,
the default MacPorts location, or if you wish to install a pre-release
version of MacPorts base. However, if you wish to
link:#installing.macports.source.multiple[install multiple copies of
MacPorts] or install MacPorts on another OS platform, you must
link:#installing.macports.source[install MacPorts from the source code].

[[installing.macports.binary]]
==== macOS Package Install

The macOS package installer automatically installs MacPorts,
link:#installing.shell[sets the shell environment], and runs a
link:#using.port.selfupdate[selfupdate] operation to update the ports
tree and MacPorts base with the latest release.

[arabic]
. Download the latest `MacPorts-{current-version}-....pkg` installer from the
releases https://github.com/macports/macports-base/releases/[on GitHub].
Here are direct links for the latest versions of macOS:
+

. Double-click the downloaded package installer to perform the default
``easy'' install.
. After this step you are done already, MacPorts is now installed and
your shell environment was set up automatically by the installer. To
confirm the installation is working as expected, now try using `port` in
a _new_ terminal window.
+
....
$ port version
....
+
....
Version: {current-version}
....
+
In case of problems such as ``command not found'', make sure that you
opened a new terminal window or consult link:#installing.shell[MacPorts
and the Shell]. Otherwise, please skip the remainder of this chapter and
continue with link:#using[???] in this guide.

[[installing.macports.source]]
==== Source Install

If you installed MacPorts using the package installer, skip this
section. To install MacPorts from the source code, follow the steps
below.

[arabic]
. Download and extract the
https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-{current-version}.tar.bz2[
MacPorts {current-version} tarball]. Either do so using your browser and the
Finder, or use the given commands in a terminal window.
+
....
$ curl -O https://distfiles.macports.org/MacPorts/MacPorts-{current-version}.tar.bz2
$ tar xf MacPorts-{current-version}.tar.bz2
....
. Afterwards, perform the commands shown in the terminal window. If you
wish to use a path other than `/opt/local`, follow the instructions for
link:#installing.macports.source.multiple[installing multiple copies of
MacPorts] instead.
+
....
$ cd MacPorts-{current-version}/
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
....
. Please continue with link:#installing.shell[MacPorts and the Shell] to
set up your shell environment.

[[installing.macports.git]]
==== Git Install

If you installed MacPorts using the package installer, skip this
section.

There are times when some may want to run MacPorts from a version newer
than the current stable release. Maybe there's a new feature that you'd
like to use, or it fixes an issue you've encountered, or you just like
to be on the cutting edge. These steps explain how to setup MacPorts for
developers, using only Git to keep MacPorts up to date.

Though a distinction is made between pre-release and release versions of
MacPorts base, the ports collection supports no such distinction or
versioning. The link:#using.port.selfupdate[selfupdate] command installs
the latest ports tree, and updates MacPorts base to the latest released
version.

[arabic]
. Check out MacPorts source
+
Pick a location to store a working copy of the MacPorts code. For this
example, `/opt/mports` will be used, but you can put the source
anywhere. This example will create `/opt/mports/macports-base`
containing everything needed for MacPorts.
+
....
$ mkdir -p /opt/mports
$ cd /opt/mports
$ git clone https://github.com/macports/macports-base.git
$ cd macports-base
$ git checkout v{current-version}  # skip this if you want to use the development version
....
. Build and Install MacPorts
+
MacPorts uses autoconf and makefiles for installation. These commands
will build and install MacPorts to `/opt/local`. You can add `--prefix`
to `./configure` to relocate MacPorts to another directory if needed.
+
....
$ cd /opt/mports/macports-base
$ ./configure --enable-readline
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ make distclean
....
. (Optional) Configure MacPorts to use port information from Git
+
This step is useful if you want to do port development. Check out the
ports tree from git:
+
....
$ cd /opt/mports
$ git clone https://github.com/macports/macports-ports.git
....
+
Then open `/opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf` in a text editor. The
last line should look like this:
+
....
rsync://rsync.macports.org/macports/release/tarballs/ports.tar [default]
....
+
Change it to point to the working copy you checked out:
+
....
file:///opt/mports/macports-ports [default]
....
+
Now MacPorts will look for portfiles in the working copy and use Git
instead of rsync to update your ports tree.
. Environment
+
You should setup your PATH and other environment options according to
link:#installing.shell[MacPorts and the Shell].

[[installing.macports.source.multiple]]
==== Install Multiple MacPorts Copies

Occasionally a MacPorts developer may wish to install more than one
MacPorts instance on the same host. Only one copy of MacPorts may use
the default prefix `/opt/local`, so for additional installations use the
option `--prefix` as shown below. It's also recommended to change the
applications dir using `--with-applications-dir` to avoid conflicts in
`/Applications/MacPorts`. Use `--without-startupitems` to automatically
set `startupitem_install no` in the new `macports.conf`, which is
required to avoid conflicts in `/Library/LaunchAgents` or
`/Library/LaunchDaemons`.

[NOTE]
====
The first command temporarily removes the standard MacPorts binary paths
because they must not be present while installing a second instance.
====

....
$ export PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
$ MP_PREFIX=/opt/macports-test
$ ./configure --prefix=$MP_PREFIX --with-applications-dir=$MP_PREFIX/Applications --without-startupitems
$ make
$ sudo make install
....

[[installing.macports.upgrade]]
=== Upgrade MacPorts

MacPorts base upgrades are performed automatically (when a newer release
is available) during a link:#using.port.selfupdate[selfupdate]
operation. To upgrade a copy of MacPorts that was installed from source
to the newer release of the source code, simply repeat the
link:#installing.macports.source[source install] with the newer version
of the MacPorts source code.

[[installing.macports.uninstalling]]
=== Uninstall MacPorts

Uninstalling MacPorts is a drastic step and, depending on the issue you
are experiencing, you may not need to do so. If you are unsure, ask on
the
https://lists.macports.org/mailman/listinfo/macports-users[macports-users]
mailing list first. If you are sure you want to uninstall, read on.

[[installing.macports.uninstalling.ports]]
==== Uninstall All Ports

If you want to uninstall MacPorts and the `port` command is functioning,
first uninstall all the installed ports by running this command in the
Terminal:

....
$ sudo port -fp uninstall installed
....

All that will be left in your installation prefix now will be files that
were not registered to any port. This includes configuration files,
databases, any files which MacPorts renamed in order to allow a forced
installation or upgrade, and the base MacPorts software itself. You may
wish to save your configuration files (most are in `$prefix/etc`),
databases, or any other unique data by moving it aside.

If the `port` command is not functioning, you can proceed on to the next
steps, but if you had installed any ports that install files to
nonstandard locations, those files might not be removed.

[[installing.macports.uninstalling.users]]
==== Remove Users and Groups

When MacPorts is installed, a `macports` macOS user and group are
created for privilege separation. If you want to remove them, you can
use these commands from an account that has admin privileges:

....
$ sudo dscl . -delete /Users/macports
$ sudo dscl . -delete /Groups/macports
....

If you configured MacPorts to use a different user or group name, then
specify that instead of `macports`.

Individual ports may create users and groups as well; you can remove
them with the same commands, but replacing `macports` with the user or
group name you wish to delete.

[[installing.macports.uninstalling.everything]]
==== Remove the Rest of MacPorts

If you want to remove all remaining traces of MacPorts, run the
following command in the Terminal. If you have changed `prefix`,
`applications_dir` or `frameworks_dir` from their default values, then
replace `/opt/local` with your `prefix`, replace
`/Applications/MacPorts` with your `applications_dir`, and/or add your
`frameworks_dir` to the list, respectively.

If you are running macOS 10.15 Catalina or later and have not disabled
System Integrity Protection (SIP), you will need to
link:#installing.macports.uninstalling.users[remove the `macports` user]
first.

....
$ sudo rm -rf \
    /opt/local \
    /Applications/DarwinPorts \
    /Applications/MacPorts \
    /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.macports.* \
    /Library/Receipts/DarwinPorts*.pkg \
    /Library/Receipts/MacPorts*.pkg \
    /Library/StartupItems/DarwinPortsStartup \
    /Library/Tcl/darwinports1.0 \
    /Library/Tcl/macports1.0 \
    ~/.macports
....

If you use a shell other than bash (perhaps tcsh), you may need to
adjust the above to fit your shell's syntax.

Depending on which version of MacPorts you have and which ports you have
installed, not all of the above paths will exist on your system; this is
OK.

[[installing.shell]]
=== MacPorts and the Shell

MacPorts requires that some environment variables be set in the shell.
When MacPorts is installed using the macOS package installer, a
``postflight'' script is run after installation that automatically adds
or modifies a shell configuration file in your home directory, ensuring
that it defines variables according to the rules described in the
following section. Those link:#installing.macports.source[installing
MacPorts from source code] must modify their environment manually using
the rules as a guide.

Depending on your shell and which configuration files already exist, the
installer may use `.zprofile`, `.profile`, `.bash_login`,
`.bash_profile`, `.tcshrc`, or `.cshrc`.

[[installing.shell.postflight]]
==== The Postflight Script

The postflight script automatically sets the `PATH` variable, and
optionally the `MANPATH` and `DISPLAY` variables according to the rules
described below. If a current shell configuration file exists at
installation time it is renamed to ``mpsaved_$timestamp''. Those
link:#installing.macports.source[installing MacPorts from source code]
must modify their environment manually using the rules as a guide.

* Required: `PATH` variable
+
This variable is set by the postflight script to prepend the MacPorts
executable paths to the current path as shown. This puts the MacPorts
paths at the front of `PATH` so that the MacPorts binaries will take
precedence over vendor-supplied binaries.
+
....
export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:$PATH
....
+
[NOTE]
====
The user environment's $PATH is not in effect while ports are being
installed, because the $PATH is scrubbed before ports are installed, and
restored afterwards. To change the search path for locating system
executables (rsync, tar, etc.) during port installation, see the
link:#internals.configuration-files.macports-conf[macports.conf] file
variable `binpath`. But changing this variable is for advanced users
only, and is not generally needed or recommended.
====
* Optional: `MANPATH` variable
+
Condition: If prior to MacPorts installation a `MANPATH` variable exists
in a current `.profile` that contains neither the value
`${prefix}/share/man,` nor any empty items separated by a colon, the
postflight script sets the `MANPATH` variable as shown below. Otherwise,
the `MANPATH` variable is omitted.
+
....
export MANPATH=/opt/local/share/man:$MANPATH
....
* Optional: `DISPLAY` variable
+
Condition: If installing on a Mac OS X version earlier than 10.5
(Leopard), and if a shell configuration file exists at time of MacPorts
installation without a `DISPLAY` variable, the postflight script sets a
`DISPLAY` variable as shown below. The `DISPLAY` variable is always
omitted on Mac OS X 10.5 or higher.
+
....
export DISPLAY=:0.0
....

[[installing.shell.verifyprofile]]
==== Verify the Configuration File

To verify that the file containing the MacPorts variables is in effect,
type `env` in the terminal to verify the current environment settings
after the file has been created. Example output for `env` is shown
below.

[NOTE]
====
Changes to shell configuration files do not take effect until a new
terminal session is opened.
====

....
MANPATH=
TERM_PROGRAM=Apple_Terminal
TERM=xterm-color
SHELL=/bin/bash
TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION=237
USER=joebob
__CF_USER_TEXT_ENCODING=0x1FC:0:0
PATH=/opt/local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin
PWD=/Users/joebob
EDITOR=/usr/bin/pico
SHLVL=1
HOME=/Users/joebob
LOGNAME=joebob
DISPLAY=:0.0
SECURITYSESSIONID=b0cea0
_=/usr/bin/env
....

[[installing.shell.editorvar]]
==== Optional Editor Variables

You can set an environment variable in order to use your favorite text
editor with the `port edit` command.

MacPorts will check `MP_EDITOR`, `VISUAL` and `EDITOR` in this order,
allowing you to either use a default editor shared with other programs
(`VISUAL` and `EDITOR`) or a MacPorts-specific one (`MP_EDITOR`).

For example, to use the nano editor, add this line to your bash config:

....
export EDITOR=/usr/bin/nano
....

To use the user-friendly GUI editor
https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/[BBEdit] (installation
required), add this line:

....
export EDITOR=/Applications/BBEdit.app/Contents/Helpers/bbedit_tool
....

To keep a command-line text editor as default while using BBEdit with
portfiles, add this:

....
export EDITOR=/usr/bin/vi
export MP_EDITOR=/Applications/BBEdit.app/Contents/Helpers/bbedit_tool
....
