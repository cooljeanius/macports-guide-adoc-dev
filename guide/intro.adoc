== Introduction

MacPorts is an easy to use system for compiling, installing, and
managing open source software. MacPorts may be conceptually divided into
two main parts: the infrastructure, known as MacPorts base, and the set
of available ports. A MacPorts port is a set of specifications contained
in a link:#development.introduction[Portfile] that defines an
application, its characteristics, and any files or special instructions
required to install it. This allows you to use a single command to tell
MacPorts to automatically download, compile, and install applications
and libraries. But using MacPorts to manage your open source software
provides several other significant advantages. For example, MacPorts:

* Installs automatically any required support software, known as
link:#reference.dependencies[dependencies], for a given port.
* Provides for uninstalls and upgrades for installed ports.
* Confines ported software to a private ``sandbox'' that keeps it from
intermingling with your operating system and its vendor-supplied
software to prevent them from becoming corrupted.
* Allows you to create pre-compiled binary installers of ported
applications to quickly install software on remote computers without
compiling from source code.

MacPorts is developed on macOS, though it is designed to be portable so
it can work on other Unix-like systems, especially those descended from
the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). In practice, installing ports
only works on macOS. MacPorts base can be compiled on Linux (and
possibly other POSIX-compatible systems) where it is mainly used to set
up mirrors and generate support files for installations on macOS.

The following notational conventions are used in the MacPorts Guide to
distinguish between terminal input/output, file text, and other special
text types.

* Terminal I/O and file text.

$ Commands to be typed into a terminal window.
